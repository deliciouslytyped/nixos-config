warn about dirty repos on build somehow, it seems possible to enumerate worktrees
TODO: script for generating a system branch / have it be automatic for activate

branch selection
tests
value inspection without full rebuild / with repl

design problem: whether you can build the configuration at any given time depends on whether a specific version of the channels branch is checked out - so it doesnt really make sense to decouple them like this...or at least, it wont be able to build with _any_ version
